This project is a Python-based implementation of a Kannada Chandassu (Prosody) Analyzer.
It processes Kannada Unicode text and classifies syllables into Laghu (short) and Guru (long) based on traditional metrical rules.
The system performs structured syllable detection and applies rule-based logic to determine the metrical pattern of the given text.

Features
* Unicode normalization for accurate Kannada text handling
* Syllable segmentation
* Laghu and Guru classification
* Rule-based metrical analysis
* Structured and readable output display

Technologies Used
* Python
* Unicode text processing
* Rule-based algorithm design
* Jupyter Notebook

Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained deeper understanding of:
* Kannada linguistic structure
* Text preprocessing techniques
* Algorithm implementation
Handling complex character encoding

Debugging real-world text processing issues
